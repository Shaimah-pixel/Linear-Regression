# Linear-Regression - Student Performance Dataset
This is a Student Performance Dataset designed to examine the factors influencing academic student performance.
In this notebook, I have implemented multiple linear regression from stratch.
Conclusion:
Performance Index is most strongly correlated with Previous Scores (0.915).
Hours Studied has a moderate, positive correlation with Performance Index (0.374).
Extracurricular Activities, Sleep Hours, and SQPP show weak correlations with performance.
#The Linear Regression and Ridge models are the best, showing identical Rsquare, adjusted Rsquare, and MSE values.
#In comparison, the Lasso and Feature Selection Model show slightly lower performance with R-squared values of 0.986785 and 0.987590, as well as higher MSEs.
#In summary, the high accuracy and adjusted R-squared value confirm that the linear regression model and Ridge is both reliable and capable of providing meaningful insights for prediction.
